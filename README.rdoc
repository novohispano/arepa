A Twitter feed for news from Venezuela using the Tweetstream gem.

=== Current Status

It displays the last 50 tweets from Venezuela performing a 'Venezuela' query and stores them in the database. I need to make a scheduler to fetch them every 5 minutes or something similar.

=== TODO

* I want to timed the fetch for every 10 minutes.
* I want to perform additional queries at the same time.
* I need to add more styling.
* I need to install VCR and write tests.
