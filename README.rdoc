A Twitter feed for news from Venezuela using the Tweetstream gem.

---

### Current Status

It displays the last 50 tweets from Venezuela performing a 'Venezuela' query. However, it performs a call to the API every time. I want to store the tweets in the database and perform a timed query.

### TODO

* I want to save the tweets in the database.
* I want to timed the fetch for every 10 minutes.
* I want to perform additional queries at the same time.
* I need to add more styling.
